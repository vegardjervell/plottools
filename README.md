# PlotTools

This is a lightweight toolbox I use for a lot of my figure generation with matplotlib. It contains some tools I frequently need, but which for some reason don't exist natively in matplotlib, like a wrapper class for colormaps, a class to easily generate different linestyles, and a cycler for marker styles.

It also contains some tools for figure scaling to make figures properly scaled when putting them in a latex document, and a matplotlibrc file that makes figure fonts and text consistent with the style I conmmonly use.

Feel free to take a look :)
